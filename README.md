I'm storing my mp3 files with a special naming *01-interpret-titel.mp3* but you'll always get something like that *1-Interpret Name-Song Title.mp3*. So I wrote this little program, to replace special characters and convert the file names to my naming scheme.

Usage:

    file_renamer.py "path_to_mp3_folder"

NOTE: It will only work on operating systems which handle their file names case sensitiv (e.g. Windows)
